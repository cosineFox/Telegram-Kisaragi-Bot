score tracking bot based on text typed with leaderboard and Ollama API integrated.

To use the bot you can:
1. download the whole thing as a zip or git clone to directory.
2. activate the python virtual environment at /bin/activate and make sure you cd the bot directory.
3. make a .env file and put TOKEN=*token here*
4. it should work.

I'll make this doc better to read later. I wanna sleep.
